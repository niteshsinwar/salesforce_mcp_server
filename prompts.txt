Salesforce MCP Test PromptsThis document contains a set of prompts to test the various capabilities of the Salesforce Multi-turn Conversation Platform (MCP), focusing on the orchestrator's ability to handle single, parallel, sequential, and mixed tool-calling scenarios.Scenario 1: Single Tool CallThese prompts should be resolved with a single call to one of the available tools.Get User DetailsShow me the details for the user 'admin@myorg.com.dev'.Expected Tool: get_user_detailsSimple SOQL QueryWhat are the names of all the permission sets available in the org?Expected Tool: execute_soql_query (with SELECT Name FROM PermissionSet)Reset a PasswordCan you please reset the password for 'test.user@example.com'?Expected Tool: reset_user_passwordGet Account DetailsFind the account details for 'GenePoint'.Expected Tool: get_account_detailsScenario 2: Parallel (Independent) Tool CallsThese prompts require the model to identify two or more independent tasks and call the necessary tools in the same turn.Multiple User LookupsGet the details for user 'user1@test.com' and also for 'user2@test.com'.Expected Tools (Parallel):get_user_details(username='user1@test.com')get_user_details(username='user2@test.com')Mixed Information RequestWhat is the annual revenue of the account 'United Oil & Gas Corp' and can you also show me the details for the 'Read Only' user profile?Expected Tools (Parallel):get_account_details(account_name='United Oil & Gas Corp')execute_soql_query(soql_query="SELECT Id, Name FROM Profile WHERE Name = 'Read Only'")Multiple Simple QueriesShow me all users with the 'Marketing User' profile and also list all lead records created today.Expected Tools (Parallel):execute_soql_query(soql_query="SELECT Name, Username FROM User WHERE Profile.Name = 'Marketing User'")execute_soql_query(soql_query="SELECT Name, Company FROM Lead WHERE CreatedDate = TODAY")Scenario 3: Sequential (Dependent) Tool CallsThese prompts require the model to perform a sequence of tasks where the output of one step is necessary for the next.Create User and Assign PermissionsCreate a new user for Jane Doe with the email 'jane.doe@example.com', username 'jane.doe@test.com', and profile 'Chatter Free User'. Once she is created, assign her the 'Read_Only_Access' and 'Sales_Tools' permission sets.Expected Sequence:create_salesforce_user(...)(In next turn) assign_permission_sets_to_user(username='jane.doe@test.com', ...)Find Account ID and Create OpportunityI need to create a new opportunity called 'Q4 Expansion Deal' for the account 'Edge Communications'. The deal size is $250,000.Expected Sequence:get_account_details(account_name='Edge Communications') to retrieve the Account ID.(In next turn) create_opportunity_for_account(account_id='<ID from step 1>', ...)Note: This tests the model's ability to follow instructions in tool docstrings.The Full Deactivation Process (Most Complex)We need to offboard a user. Please deactivate 'john.smith@test.com' and transfer all of his accounts, contacts, leads, and opportunities to 'jane.doe@test.com'.Expected Tool: deactivate_salesforce_user. This tool encapsulates the entire sequence, but the model must correctly identify the two usernames and call the single, powerful tool. This tests the model's ability to prefer a high-level tool over a manual, multi-step process.Scenario 4: Mixed (Hybrid) ScenariosThese prompts combine parallel and sequential calls, representing the most complex real-world requests.Create User, Assign Permissions, and Simultaneously Check an AccountOnboard our new analyst, Tom Ford. His username is 'tom.ford@test.com', email is 't.ford@example.com', and profile is 'Read Only'. After he is created, assign him the 'Analytics_User_Permissions' permission set.
