As an expert developer, your plan is to first, use execute_soql_query to fetch Id, Name, Industry, AnnualRevenue, BillingCountry for the 10 latest accounts, ensuring the result is a clean JSON string; second, use create_python_tool_for_salesforce to build a tool that accepts a JSON string, uses json.loads() to parse it, and then pandas to create an Excel file; finally, execute the new tool using the JSON string from the first step as its input.
